** Motivation
- Reusing test job definitions
** API style
*** Command line shell script
**** Pros
- Easy to provide (if there is none yet)
- Avoid recompilation
- /Common/
**** Cons
- /Time sensitivity/
** Board management layer detection
*** /usr/lib/test/test.d
- lava-board-control,
- ttc-board-control,
- labgrid-board-control,
- beaker-board-control,
- libvirt-board-control,
- r4d-board-control,
- etc.
*** /etc/test.d
- Communication (if not CLI)
- Further configuration
** Single set of APIs (for board management layer communication)
*** list-boards
- Introspection of the board layer managed objects
- What about other board features?
*** list-features
- Introspection of the board management layer supported features
- Extensions: ``x-labgrid-set-gpio''
*** reserve, release (and renew)
- Reserving a board
- Many existing frameworks might expect to be the only client
- How long the delay might be (if any)? Use historical data?
- Priorities required
*** reboot, power-on and power-off
- Booting the board
*** get-serial-device
- Get serial port for the board
*** More _complex_ verbs
- run, copy_to, copy_from (executing commands, transferring files)
- install-kernel, install-root-filesystem (provisioning)
*** Synchronous vs asynchronous
- Which are more common?
- Which are more convenient?
** Modularity
*** Multiple schedulers
- Board manager (board reservations)
- Job/task/test scheduler for actions
